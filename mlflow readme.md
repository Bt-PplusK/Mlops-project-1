# MLFlow Setup

A Jupyter notebook [Resume_screening.ipynb](Resume_screening.ipynb) was set up to train resume classifier using theUpdatedResumeDataSet.cv. This model was then used to explote different parameters to find the optimal parametes for the model. Each set of parameters was saved as an experiment.

The notebook has mlfow commands to:

- create experiment

- log specific metrics

- perform auto-logging
